Confusion Matrix for Spam Classification
This Python script generates a confusion matrix and visualizes it using a heatmap. It's designed for binary classification scenarios, helping to evaluate the performance of a classification model. Modify the values in y_true and y_pred for your specific classification results.

 Stacked Bar Chart
This Python script creates a stacked bar chart to visualize the true positives, false negatives, false positives, and true negatives in a confusion matrix. It offers an alternative perspective on the classification model's performance. Customize the values accordingly for your classification results.

Precision-Recall Curve
This Python script generates a precision-recall curve, providing insights into the trade-off between precision and recall for a classification model. It's particularly useful for assessing performance in imbalanced datasets. Adjust the values in y_true and y_pred based on your classification results.

ROC Curve
This Python script plots the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve, illustrating the model's ability to discriminate between positive and negative classes. The area under the ROC curve (AUC) quantifies the overall performance. Customize the values in y_true and y_pred for your specific classification outcomes.
